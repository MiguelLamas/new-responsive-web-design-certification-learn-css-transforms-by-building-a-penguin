# new-responsive-web-design-certification-learn-css-transforms-by-building-a-penguin

Reviewing fundamentals of HTML and CSS via the freeCodeCamp - (New) Responsive Web Design Certification, practicing how to build webpages using HTML for content, and CSS for design.

I wanted to review how to transform HTML elements and create appealing designs that engage a user's eye. I wanted to learn about using transforms to rotate elements, scale them, and more.

I built a penguin using CSS transforms to position and resize the parts of that make up the penguin character, created a background, and animated the whole scene.
